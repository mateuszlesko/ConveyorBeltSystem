# ConveyorBeltSystem
PLC pair project, which we had to do a conveyor belt system based on PLC Siemens S7-1200.
Conveyor belt system contains a 3 conveyor belt that run seperatly. It can be only one thing at the same time on every conveyor belt.
## Functionalites:
- exchanging packages between 3 conveyor belts
- real time diagnostic : emergency channels (when count of packages on start is not equal at the end) 
- securing the continuity of work: blockade (only one thing can be at the same line at the same time)
- switching the engine on for a specified period of time
